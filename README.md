 Project Overview: Vulnerability Scanner
This Java program is a basic network vulnerability scanning tool designed for educational purposes. It scans a target system (an IP address or website) to identify potential security vulnerabilities, including:

Key Features:
Port Scanning:

Scans the first 1024 ports on the target system.
Detects open ports where services might be running.
Provides a list of open ports for further investigation.
HTTP Header Analysis:

Fetches and displays HTTP headers from the target website.
Checks for:
Outdated Software: Identifies old versions of servers like Apache or Nginx.
Misconfigurations: Warns if sensitive headers like X-Powered-By or X-AspNet-Version are exposed, as they can leak information about backend technologies.
